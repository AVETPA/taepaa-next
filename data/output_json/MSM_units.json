    "Assessment Conditions": "The unit should be assessed holistically and the judgement of competence based on a holistic assessment of the evidence. The collection of performance evidence:should provide evidence of the ability to perform over the range of situations which might be expected to be encountered, including typical disruptions to normal, smooth work conditionsmay use industry-based simulation particularly where safety, lack of opportunity or significant cost is an issue.Off-the-job assessment must sufficiently reflect realistic operational workplace conditions that cover all aspects of workplace performance, including environment, task skills, task management skills, contingency management skills and job role environment skills.  Assessment in a simulated environment should use evidence collected from one or more of: walk-throughsdemonstration of skills industry based case studies/scenarios ‘what ifs’.Knowledge evidence may be collected concurrently with performance evidence (provided a record is kept) or through an independent process, such as workbooks, written assessments or interviews (provided a record is kept). Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.Conditions for assessment must include access to all tools, equipment, materials and documentation required, including relevant workplace procedures, product and manufacturing specifications associated with this unit.The regulatory framework will be reflected in workplace policies and procedures and is not required to be independently assessed.Foundation skills are integral to competent performance of the unit and should not be assessed separately.As a minimum, assessors must satisfy the Standards for Registered Training Organisations 2015 assessor requirements."
