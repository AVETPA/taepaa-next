hazards is not increased.\n3.9\nMeasures to control assessed risks are developed and implemented in accordance with the hierarchy of control, relevant occupational health and safety legislation, codes of practices and trends identified from the occupational health and safety records system.\n3.10\nWhen measures which control a risk at its source are not immediately practicable, interim solutions are implemented until a control measure is developed.\n3.11\nA procedure for ongoing control of risks, based on the hierarchy of control, is developed and integrated with general systems of work and procedures.\n3.12\nActivities are monitored to ensure that the risk control procedure is adopted effectively throughout the area of managerial responsibility.\n3.13\nRisk control is addressed at the planning, design and evaluation stages of any change within the area of managerial responsibility to ensure that adequate risk control measures are included.\n3.14\nInadequacies in existing risk control measures are identified in accordance with the hierarchy of control, and resources enabling implementation of new measures are sought and/or provided according to appropriate procedures.\n4\nEstablish and maintain procedures for dealing with hazardous events.\n4.1\nPotential hazardous events are correctly identified.\n4.2\nProcedures which would control the risks associated with hazardous events and meet any legislative requirements as a minimum are developed in consultation with appropriate emergency services.\n4.3\nAppropriate information and training is provided to all employees to enable implementation of the correct procedures in all relevant circumstances.\n5\nEstablish and maintain OHS training program.\n5.1\nAn occupational health and safety training program is developed and implemented to identify and fulfil employees’ occupational health and safety training needs as part of the organisation’s general training program.\n6\nEstablish and maintain a system for OHS records.\n6.1\nA system for keeping occupational health and safety records is established and monitored to allow identification of patterns of occupational injury and disease within the area of managerial responsibility.\n7\nEvaluate the OHS system and related policies, procedures and programs.\n7.1\nThe effectiveness of the occupational health and safety system and related policies, procedures and programs is assessed according to the organisation’s aims with respect to occupational health and safety.\n7.2\nImprovements to the occupational health and safety system are developed and implemented to ensure more effective achievements of the organisation’s aims with respect to occupational health and safety.\n7.3\nCompliance with occupational health and
