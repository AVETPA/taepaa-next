Foundation skills are integral to competent performance of the unit and should not be assessed separately. Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.Knowledge evidence may be collected concurrently with performance evidence or through an independent process, such as workbooks, written assessments or interviews (provided a record is kept in each case).This unit of competency may be assessed with: MSL943004 Participate in laboratory or field workplace safetyHolistic assessment methods include: review of the candidate’s job sheets or logs of completed activitiesreview of the quality of results traceable to the transport of samples or equipment by candidatefeedback from supervisors, other laboratory personnel and customers about the candidate’s ability to communicate effectively and safely handle and transport samples and equipment in accordance with workplace procedures and schedulesdirect observation of the candidate’s work as a courieroral or written questions to assess knowledge of workplace requirements for the handling and transport of samples and equipmentsimulated role plays covering interactions between a courier and personnel at a reception desk or customer pickup centre.Access is required to instruments, equipment, materials, workplace documentation, procedures and specifications associated with this unit, including, but not limited to:transport vehicle, containers for transporting samples and test/calibration equipment, and communication devicesworkplace protocols and procedures covering the handling and transport of samples or equipment.Assessors must satisfy the assessor competency requirements that are in place at the time of the assessment as set by the VET regulator.  The assessor must demonstrate both technical competence and currency.Technical competence can be demonstrated through:relevant VET or other qualification/Statement of Attainment AND/ORrelevant workplace experience.Currency can be demonstrated through:performing the competency being assessed as part of current employment ORhaving consulted with a laboratory about performing the competency being assessed within the last twelve months."
