Establish the context\n1.1 Organisations' activity/location/equipment maintenance and operational procedures are obtained\n1.2 Activity/location/equipment operating and maintenance history is obtained including relevant incident and failure reports\n1.3 Applicable occupational health and safety and environmental standards are researched\n1.4 Applicable technical documentation is obtained\n1.5 Risk criteria, as determined by the organisation’s risk management policy and plan, are accessed and clarified\n2. Identify risks\n2.1 A comprehensive list of sources of risks within the particular activity is generated, including risks that are not under the control of the organisation\n2.2 Areas of impact on the organisation are taken into consideration\n2.3 Possible causes of risks are considered\n2.4 Sources of risk and areas of impact are documented in a clear and concise manner\n3. Conduct risk analysis\n3.1 Analysis is completed using appropriate methodology in accordance with organisations' and/or activity requirements\n3.2 Existing control, likelihood and consequences are determined\n3.3 Level of risk is compared to previously established risk criteria\n4. Undertake risk assessment\n4.1 Level of risks are compared against previously established risk criteria and decisions made as to whether risks can be accepted\n4.2 Risks are prioritised, taking account of the wider context of the risk\n4.3 Consideration is given to the tolerability of the risks borne by parties other than the organisation that benefits from it\n4.4 Risks that fall into the low or acceptable categories may be accepted without further treatment, monitored and periodically reviewed to ensure they remain acceptable\n4.5 Risks that fall outside the low or acceptable category are treated using a range of options\n5. Treat risks\n5.1 Risk treatment options are identified such as retaining the risk, reducing the likelihood of occurrence, reducing the consequence or transferring the risk\n5.2 Risk treatment options are evaluated in accordance with the organisation’s risk management plan, on the basis of the extent of risk reduction, the extent of benefits or opportunities created and taking into account the risk criteria previously established\n5.3 Risk treatment plans are prepared identifying responsibilities, schedules, the expected outcome of treatments, budgeting, performance measures and the review process set in place\n5.4 Risk analysis and treatment options are documented, in accordance with the organisation’s procedures\n5.5 Risk treatment plans are implemented prior to and during the conduct of an activity\n6. Monitor and review the risk management plan\n6.1 Risks and the effectiveness of control measures are monitored in accordance with the organisation’s risk management plan to ensure changing circumstances do not alter risk priorities\n6.2 The risk analysis is repeated regularly to ensure the risk treatment plan remains relevant\n6.3 Changes to the conduct of an activity are made, where required, in accordance with review recommendations\n6.4 Recommendations in accordance with the organisation’s risk audit are implemented in future risk analysis of activities",
