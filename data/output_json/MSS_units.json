The assessor must demonstrate both technical competency and currency.Technical competence can be demonstrated through:relevant VET or other qualification/Statement of Attainment AND/ORrelevant workplace experience Currency can be demonstrated through:performing the competency being assessed as part of current employment ORhaving consulted with an organisation providing relevant environmental monitoring, management or technology services about performing the competency being assessed within the last twelve months."

Assessment should be run using a ‘war gaming’ model where the simulated non-conformance has a defined start and additional information becomes available as the exercise progresses. This may be a ‘desk top’ exercise and is best run with the team of individuals who would need to respond and may occur in an ‘incident room’ or could be run using digital communication and information. The incident should be progressively elaborated as the exercise progresses, and may, or may not be completed within one day.Knowledge evidence may be collected concurrently with performance evidence or through an independent process such as workbooks, written assessments or interviews (provided a record is kept).Assessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.Conditions for assessment must include access to all tools, equipment, materials and documentation required, including relevant workplace procedures, product and manufacturing specifications associated with this unit.Foundation skills are integral to competent performance of the unit and should not be assessed separately.Assessors must satisfy the assessor competency requirements that are in place at the time of the assessment as set by the VET regulator.  The assessor must demonstrate both technical competency and currency.Technical competence can be demonstrated through:relevant VET or other qualification/Statement of Attainment AND/ORrelevant workplace experience Currency can be demonstrated through:performing the competency being assessed as part of current employment ORhaving consulted with an organisation providing relevant environmental monitoring, management or technology services about performing the competency being assessed within the last twelve months."
