    "Performance Evidence": "Evidence required to demonstrate competence in this unit must be relevant to and satisfy all of the requirements of the elements and performance criteria on at least one occasion and include:\ncommunicating effectively with others, including the Master, when transmitting and receiving information by visual signallingkeeping records of visual signalling communicationsreading and interpreting maritime regulations relating to visual signallingtransmitting and receiving by Morse light, distress signal SOS as specified in Annex IV International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) and Appendix 1 of the International Code of Signalstransmitting and receiving messages using flags according to the International Code of Signalsusing International Maritime Organization (IMO) Standard Marine Communication Phrases and using English in written and oral termsusing the International Code of Signals.",
    "Knowledge Evidence": "Evidence required to demonstrate competence in this unit must be relevant to and satisfy all of the requirements of the elements and performance criteria and include knowledge of:\nAustralian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)IMO Standard Marine Communication PhrasesInternational Code of Signals including:morse codesingle letter and numeral international code flagsmessages including:distress signal SOSmedical advicesingle letter flag signal codesprocedures for:sending visual messages with flags using the International Code of Signalsusing a flashing light to send messages using Morse codevisual signalling of single letter signals as specified in the International Code of Signalswork health and safety (WHS)/occupational health and safety (OHS) requirements and work practices.",
    "Assessment Conditions": "Assessors must hold credentials specified within the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment. \nAssessment must satisfy the Principles of Assessment and Rules of Evidence and all regulatory requirements included within the Standards for Registered Training Organisations current at the time of assessment.\nAssessment processes and techniques must be appropriate to the language, literacy and numeracy requirements of the work being performed and the needs of the candidate.\nPractical assessment must occur in a workplace, or realistic simulated workplace, under the normal range of workplace conditions. \nSimulations and scenarios may be used where situations cannot be provided in the workplace or may occur only rarely, in particular for situations relating to emergency procedures and adverse weather conditions where assessment would be unsafe, impractical or may lead to environmental damage.\nResources for assessment must include access to:\napplicable documentation, such as legislation, regulations, codes of practice, workplace procedures and operational manualstools, equipment, machinery, materials and relevant personal protective equipment (PPE) currently used in industry."
